[00:31.34] Where the spring mists settle
[00:34.14] As the valleys breathe
[00:36.50] And the Hillock's shadow, light, and calm
[00:40.59] You're naught to feel unwanted
[00:42.85] Though the world might abhor
[00:45.14] Your home is in Victoria, Victoria once more
[01:07.14] 
[00:56.31] When the night wind calls us
[00:58.64] To the tussling fields
[01:00.66] Lost in battle, weary in your heart
[01:04.96] I'll uphold her honor
[01:07.26] As we march to the shore
[01:09.31] And I will see Victoria, Victoria once more
[01:13.66] My heart will sing Victoria, Victoria once more
[01:37.16] 
[02:07.30] Her light a harbor for faithless
[02:09.70] She won't let you fall
[02:11.16] When the darkness calls you
[02:13.98] Anchor safe in her walls
[02:16.07] Like a shield, she's Victoria
[02:18.23] Her love for you is an army
[02:20.32] Protected and served
[02:22.17] When you're lost, unwanted
[02:24.67] She's your hope preserved
[02:26.74] Like a sword, she's Victoria
[02:40.74] 
[02:30.86] Even if I wander
[02:35.12] Yon' the hills towards Sargon
[02:39.77] She'll keep calling
[02:41.79] And her beacon lead
[02:43.87] Like a warship steady through the storm
[02:48.16] I am left unshaken, I'm safe in her arms
[03:08.16] 
[02:54.73] The solace of Victoria
[02:59.34] Hopeful in Victoria
[03:03.11] My heart will sing Victoria
[03:16.61] 
[03:07.78] We will march past the dusty moors
[03:10.25] Shake off a thousand wars
[03:12.39] Leaving, not left alone
[03:14.33] Victoria is our home!
[03:24.83] 
[03:57.29] You're naught to feel unwanted
[03:59.81] Though the world might abhor
[04:04.97] Your home is in Victoria
[04:10.25] Once more
